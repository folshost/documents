\paragraph{}
Linear regression is a method of fitting a model to a data set in order to obtain a linear model minimizing error between observed and fitted values based on a number of input variables, known as regressors. The goal is to obtain a model of weights $x$, so that any input row, or set of input rows for which you have regressor data can be used to predict the value of another, related variable, the value of which you do not have access to, or which it may otherwise be too costly to obtain. A simple example is if you wanted to determine the likely productivity of a corn field. If you can create a model based on rain, fertilizing, or other variables, you can not only predict the productivity of the field at harvest, but also use the coefficients obtained in the model to compare the relative contribution of regressors on field productivity.

The Phylanx Distributed Array Processing toolkit is a project being undertaken by the Ste||ar Group at LSU, built using the HPX runtime. This system has many single-node functions implemented, but before we started this project it had very few distributed primitives implemented. Because of matrix multiplication's foundational importance in machine learning algorithms, we chose it as our first major foray into distributed functionality. In order to provide options to users, we chose to implement two different algorithms, a tiling ambivalent one, as well as Cannonâ€™s algorithm. We found that in a single node distributed test, both of our algorithms outperformed the serial version.
